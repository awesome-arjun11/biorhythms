# Biorhythms

A type of pseudoscience, originated in the 19th century and became popular in the 60's, 70's and 80's. Biorhythms are based on the idea that a person's life is on a cycle, with peaks and troughs. Using mathematical formulas, people can calculate and graph their cycles, thus determining good days (peaks) and bad days (troughs).

## why

Even though no scientific evidence exists of biorhythm's predictive power. Still its was fun.
